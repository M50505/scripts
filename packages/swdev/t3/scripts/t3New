cd ~/projects

#	Create the node.js application - this will create a new directory under ~/projects
#	Remember to have the project directory for the new app already present and it must be
# a local copy of an existing repository.
#	It is recommended that before creating the T3 app, delete all contents of the app
#	local repository directoty EXCEPT for .git and .gitignore.
#	Whe t3 create asks what to do about the existing directory, tell it to overwrite the existing
#	contents.
#
#	FInally, use pnpm to run the app either in dev mode or production mode:
#
#	pnpm dev
#
#	-- or --
#
#	pnpm run
